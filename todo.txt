Admin GUI:
* Automatic Connect to server
* Admin GUI should be able to register or verify new tables (with mac address)
* Export/Import database
* Waiter
	* Create new waiter
	* Block waiter (mayby he was fired)
	* ? Change waiter personal information, e.g. password 

Table:
* Waiter support
	* Connect between waiters and orders
	* Waiter information 

Waiter:
* Login as waiter
* ? Change personal information, e.g. password
* Show active orders
* Accept order (maybe some restriction e.g. 3 actice orders at once)
* Show undone waiter's order



Server:
* New database design
* Execute network commands one after another (stack)
* Log all network communications to /var/log/rotable-server-comm.log
* Communication with Waiter
	* Accept Waiter request
		* list active orders
		* list undone orders depends of waiter
		* reserve order by waiter
	* Send update order list after change



Shared:
* TCPClient implementation of Admin and Table is possibly the same and also 
  usable for Waiter.
* encryp TCP communication

Suggestion:
* Show time to done order (waiter can set this time)
* Show on table orders count in stock (custommer can see how many orders are before his order)
  (maybe that can be realized by this same code as send information to waiters)
